##High Concept:
Prove your ability in a military firing range, show your weapon proficeny and avoid civilians,
what are you capable of? Show us.
                    
##Genre:
Firing range is an arcade first person shooter with a more serious feel. 
Inspiration wise, this was derived from the Call of Duty serious. 
In most of the campaigns and even some of the multiplayers, they had firing 
ranges that you would either test your accuracy or prove your worth. Usually, 
to prove your worth it would be more of a course where you are actively moving, 
but seeing that a 3D game is a little out of scope a 2D version will suffice.
Well its more a faux 3D, in the sense that there is elements of depth, but there won't
be any true 3D components.

##Platforms:
As of now, Firing Range, will be desktop only, though mobile doesn't seem that crazy of a leap.
As for console, I think Firing Range will stay away from controllers (ideally).

##Esthetics:
###Graphics:
The graphics are going to be more on the realistic side, but still have appearnt cartoonish
aspects. Think of any browser game that tries to have realistic graphics, but it can't because
of limitaions or for whatever reason.

###Sound:
The sound will be pretty realist, but not perfect. Gun shots are the main sound in Firing Range,
which is a simple sound, but there wont be echo or other aspects of sound that come from firing a weapon
(at least as of now).

##Gameplay:
As for gameplay, my idea is there will be 5 stages, each increasing in difficulty.
Each stage will have an overall goal for each of the 4 divisions/squads 
(Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta). 
The goal will be a culmination of the three scores you will be tested on throughout
the session. The three scores are, Time: how fast can you clear the stage?, 
Civilian Casualties: how many civilans did you kill?, and Ammunition: how many bullets did it take to complete the stage?.

A general layout for a session will consist of the player (camera)
being set behind the firing line, where they will stay for the entirety
of the session (as of now). When the session starts, the timer will start,
and targets will start popping up at various distances, and with various
body showing (if they are behind an obstacle or not). Throughout the session
there will also be some civilians who got caught up in the crossfire.
Depending on the difficulty, the civilian could either be by itself,
or in front of an enemy as a hostage, to make it harder. During each session,
the player will have unlimited ammo, but depending on how much they use will
affect the score. At the end of the 5 rounds, the players scores will be
totalled up and they will be presented with an offer for one of the squads.
Where do you think you will end up?

##Mechanics:
As for mechanics, I would really like to implement recoil and range drop off,
so the further out the target the higher the player would need to aim.
I donâ€™t think wind would be a great addition, so for now I plan to leave that out.

##Controls:
..*Mouse: Aim
..*Left Mouse Button: Shoot
..*Right Mouse Button: Look Down Sight
..*Space: Reload

##OnBoarding:
To introduce the player to Firing Range, there will be a tutorial option for players who want to use it.
It will show them the controls, and have them get a feel for what the rest of the game will be like.

##Learning the Game:
Other than the contorls, there's only one real aspect of the game to learn that is huge. The stages themselves.
One very important note, is that each level will be exactly the same everytime. This makes it so,
if you the player takes the time to practice and redo the levels again and again, then eventaully,
the player will know what will happen before it does, which will give the player a huge advantage.

##Hopes:
If possible, I would like to have multiple weapon choices,
that have different stats based on what you may want. 
For example, a rifle that has a better accuracy at range, 
but a slower fire rate and a higher recoil, or a pistol, 
that has a lower accuracy at range, but a higher fire rate and a lower recoil. 
There are opportunities for more choices, with different stats as well.
